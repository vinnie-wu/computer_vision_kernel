## Installing Required Libraries

To install the NumPy, SciPy and Imageio libraries you can run `python -m pip install numpy scipy imageio`

## Running Test Cases Locally

To run the four provided test cases you can run `python test.py`.

## Generating Cross Correlation Images

To generate a cross correlation GIF, run `python make_correlation_video.py <filename of gif>`. This depends on your implementation of the `make_correlation_video` function so if you haven't done that yet it will not do anything.
